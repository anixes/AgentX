# Phase 27: Autonomous Strategy Learning & Self-Evolution

## Objective
Transform AgentX from a task-solver into a strategic learner capable of simulating outcomes, refining its own execution patterns, and autonomously generating its own curriculum for self-improvement.

## Core Components

### 1. Multi-Plan Simulation Layer
AgentX now evaluates multiple potential execution paths before committing to one.
- **Simulation Engine**: Predicts success probability, risk, and latency for each candidate plan.
- **Simulation-Aware Selection**: Uses a weighted scoring model ($Score = 0.5 \times Success - 0.3 \times Risk - 0.2 \times Latency$) to pick the optimal path.
- **Diversity Enforcement**: Forcing strategic variety in candidates to prevent repetitive planning traps.

### 2. Strategy Store & Reflection
- **Post-Execution Reflection**: After every mission, the agent analyzes what worked and what failed.
- **Strategy Extraction**: Successful workflows are distilled into reusable strategic patterns stored in `agentx_strategies.json`.
- **Weighting & Decay**: Strategies are weighted by their historical performance, with old successes gradually decaying to allow for fresh innovations.

### 3. Adaptive Exploration (Epsilon-Greedy)
- **Exploit vs. Explore**: The agent balances using trusted, high-confidence strategies with exploring experimental approaches.
- **Dynamic Epsilon**: The exploration rate adapts based on the overall system success rate. High success reduces exploration; high failure increases it to discover new fixes.

### 4. Self-Generated Curriculum
- **Skill Gap Detection**: Automatically identifies weak areas in its reasoning or tool usage based on task failures.
- **Synthetic Training**: Generates sandbox missions (safe, isolated tasks) during idle time to practice specific skills.
- **Adaptive Difficulty**: The curriculum difficulty scales as the agent improves, ensuring continuous growth.

## Strategic Impact
This phase enables AgentX to handle "out-of-distribution" problems by simulating alternatives and learning from every encounter, eventually building a comprehensive tactical library that outperforms static planning algorithms.
