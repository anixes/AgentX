# Research Post-Mortem: Claude Codebase Audit

## 🎯 Objective
The primary goal was to map the architectural spine of the Claude Codebase—understanding how it handles command parsing, security, session persistence, and multi-agent orchestration—and to replicate those patterns in a standalone toolkit.

## 🔍 Key Discoveries

### 1. The Security "Spine"
We discovered that Claude's security is not a single check, but a multi-stage pipeline:
- **Normalization**: Converting complex user input into a predictable format.
- **Stripping**: Removing "noise" (env vars, safe wrappers) to reveal the root binary.
- **AST Parsing**: Understanding the *structure* of the command rather than just the keywords.

### 2. Multi-Agent Orchestration
We mapped the distinction between:
- **Subagents**: In-process, shared context, used for micro-parallelization.
- **Swarms (Teammates)**: Multi-process, independent sessions, used for macro-parallelization.

### 3. MCP Extensibility
We analyzed the content-based signature system used to deduplicate servers and the enterprise lockdown policies that ensure corporate security.

## 🛠️ The Build (Legacy Toolkit)

We distilled these insights into three core scripts:
1.  **`gateway.py`**: A unified client for NVIDIA, Groq, and BYO-API providers.
2.  **`stripper.py`**: A Python implementation of Claude's "Permission Stripping" logic.
3.  **`safe_shell.py`**: A secure REPL that analyzes command risks via AI before execution.

## 💡 Lessons Learned
- **Fail-Open is Critical**: Security tools should warn but not unnecessarily break the developer's workflow.
- **BYO-API is the Future**: Agnostic gateways that let users bring their own keys (NVIDIA/Groq) provide the best balance of speed and cost.
- **AST > Regex**: Validating shell commands requires understanding the syntax tree; simple string matching is always bypassable.
