# Phase 23: Memory + Failure Intelligence + Autonomous Scheduling

## Overview
Phase 23 transforms AgentX from a reactive executor into a learning system that remembers past executions to improve future planning and automates recurring tasks.

## Core Features

### 1. Experience Memory System (`experience_store.py`)
AgentX now records every execution in an `ExperienceStore`.
- **Data Points**: Goal, Plan structure, Result (Success/Failure), Metrics (Latency, Cost), and Error reasons.
- **Persistent Learning**: Experiences are stored with embeddings for semantic retrieval.

### 2. Failure Intelligence
When generating new plans, the planner queries the `ExperienceStore` for similar past failures.
- **Penalty Application**: Plans similar to previous failures are penalized during the scoring phase to prevent repeating mistakes.
- **Failure Clustering**: API endpoints allow analyzing clusters of similar failures to identify systematic tool or logic weaknesses.

### 3. Autonomous Scheduling
The system can now schedule tasks based on priority and deadlines.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: The agent loop checks for due tasks and initiates them autonomously.
- **Failure Recovery**: Automated retries for failed high-priority tasks using insights from the failure memory.

## Technical Details
- **Experience Model**: Located in `agentx/memory/experience_store.py`.
- **Integration**: Plumbed into `planner.py` for plan biasing and `metrics.py` for performance tracking.
