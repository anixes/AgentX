# AgentX: Adaptive Execution & Control Playbook

This document outlines the advanced capabilities of AgentX Core, a research-aligned agentic system built for reliable, autonomous terminal operations.

## 🔬 4-Layer Agent Architecture

AgentX follows a modern 4-layer agentic architecture to ensure stability and explainability:

1.  **Execution Layer**: Handles raw actions via a curated **Skill Library** (Action Abstractions) and **Hierarchical Execution** (Composition).
2.  **Control Layer**: Enforces reliability through a **Multi-Agent Evaluation Layer** and a **Strategy Selection Module**.
3.  **Learning Layer**: Persists experience in **Vectorized Memory** and **Adaptive Replanning Loops** to self-correct failures.
4.  **Routing Layer**: Performs **Predictive Routing** to choose optimal execution paths before spending tokens.

## 🚀 Key Capabilities

### 1. Strategy Selection Module (Decision Making)
**Problem**: Hardcoded rules fail on complex, novel tasks.
**Solution**: The system uses a strategic dispatch layer to choose between low-level Skills, Hierarchical Composition, or Parallel Swarms. Decisions are gated by a **Rule Engine** that converts repeated failures into deterministic policies.

### 2. Multi-Agent Evaluation & Judge Layer
**Problem**: Single-model evaluation is prone to hallucinations and "Yes-man" bias.
**Solution**: AgentX uses a layered consensus pipeline:
*   **Deterministic Guards**: Code-level verification of postconditions.
*   **Weighted Consensus**: Votes from diverse models (GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5, Claude 3.5) weighted by historical accuracy.
*   **Minority Veto**: High-reliability models can override a success verdict if they detect a failure.
*   **Meta-Evaluation**: The system evaluates its own judges to detect drift or bias.

### 3. Uncertainty-Aware Execution
**Problem**: Errors accumulate silently in long-horizon tasks, leading to "hallucination loops."
**Solution**: Uncertainty is a first-class control signal.
*   **Uncertainty Propagation**: Every step carries an `uncertainty_score`.
*   **Compound Risk Tracking**: The system tracks drift across the entire task trajectory.
*   **Hard Stop Gates**: Execution halts immediately and escalates to a human if cumulative uncertainty exceeds safe bounds (0.8).

### 4. Predictive Routing Layer
**Problem**: Complex multi-evaluator cascades are expensive and slow for simple tasks.
**Solution**: Before execution starts, the system analyzes the objective's complexity and uncertainty trend.
*   **Fast-Path**: Simple tasks use a single evaluator to save cost and latency.
*   **Cascade-Path**: High-complexity tasks are forced into the full multi-agent consensus gate.
*   **Early Abstention**: If the task is predicted to be unresolvable, the system escalates to the user *before* attempting execution.

### 6. Experience-Driven Learning (RL-lite)
**Problem**: Agents often repeat the same sub-optimal patterns across different missions.
**Solution**: AgentX implements a lightweight behavioral learning layer.
*   **Policy Store**: Persists success scores for plan patterns, tools, and reasoning modes.
*   **Reward Optimization**: Future planning is biased toward high-reward trajectories (`Success - Latency - Risk`).
*   **Failure Memory**: Plans similar to historical failures are automatically penalized, preventing recurring loops.

### 7. Governed Autonomy & Intent Generation
**Problem**: Reactive agents require constant human prompting.
**Solution**: The **Intent Engine** generates self-initiated goals based on system health, scheduled tasks, and user patterns.
*   **Risk-Gated Autonomy**: Autonomous actions are limited by a strict safety budget and cooldown periods.
*   **Benefit Scoring**: Only tasks with high predicted user value are initiated without approval.

### 8. Long-Term Multi-Device Orchestration
**Problem**: Persistent tasks get lost if the system restarts or moves between environments.
**Solution**: The **Goal Engine** manages long-horizon objectives across Phone, PC, and Cloud.
*   **Persistent State**: Goals are tracked from `PENDING` to `DONE` across system reboots.
*   **Intelligent Routing**: Tasks are dispatched to the optimal hardware node based on tool requirements.
